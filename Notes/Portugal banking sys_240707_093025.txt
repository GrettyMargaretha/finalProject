This dataset is public available for research. The details are described in S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita. A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing. Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 62:22-31, June 2014

• Title: Bank Marketing (with social/economic context)

• Sources
Created by: Sérgio Moro (ISCTE-IUL), Paulo Cortez (Univ. Minho) and Paulo Rita (ISCTE-IUL) @ 2014

• Past Usage:

The full dataset (bank-additional-full.csv) was described and analyzed in:

S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita. A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing. Decision Support Systems (2014), doi:10.1016/j.dss.2014.03.001.

• Relevant Information:

This dataset is based on "Bank Marketing" UCI dataset (please check the description at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing).
The data is enriched by the addition of five new social and economic features/attributes (national wide indicators from a ~10M population country), published by the Banco de Portugal and publicly available at: https://www.bportugal.pt/estatisticasweb.
This dataset is almost identical to the one used in [Moro et al., 2014] (it does not include all attributes due to privacy concerns).
Using the rminer package and R tool (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rminer/), we found that the addition of the five new social and economic attributes (made available here) lead to substantial improvement in the prediction of a success, even when the duration of the call is not included. Note: the file can be read in R using: d=read.table("bank-additional-full.csv",header=TRUE,sep=";")

The binary classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a bank term deposit (variable y).

• Number of Instances: 41188 for bank-additional-full.csv

   - **Effect on Term Deposit**: Age and job type together can influence financial stability and risk preferences, affecting the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit. For example, older, retired clients might prefer term deposits for secure income, while younger clients in stable jobs might also find them appealing for savings.

2. **Marital Status** and **Housing Loan**:
   - **Relationship**: Married clients are more likely to have housing loans due to shared financial responsibilities.
   - **Effect on Term Deposit**: Clients with housing loans might have less disposable income for term deposits, but married clients might still consider term deposits for joint savings.

3. **Education** and **Job**:
   - **Relationship**: Higher education levels often correlate with higher-paying jobs.
   - **Effect on Term Deposit**: Clients with higher education and better jobs may have more disposable income and better financial literacy, making them more likely to subscribe to term deposits.

4. **Default** and **Loan** (Personal and Housing):
   - **Relationship**: Clients with a history of default are less likely to have personal or housing loans approved due to higher risk.

5. **Contact Communication Type** and **Duration**:
   - **Relationship**: The mode of contact can influence the length of the interaction. Cellular contacts might lead to longer, more engaging conversations.
   - **Effect on Term Deposit**: Longer durations of contact, especially via cellular communication, can increase the likelihood of successful conversion to a term deposit due to better engagement.

6. **Month** and **Day of Week**:
   - **Relationship**: Certain months and days might be more effective for contacting clients based on their routines and financial cycles.
   - **Effect on Term Deposit**: Timing of contact can influence client mood and availability, impacting the success rate of term deposit subscriptions.

7. **Campaign** and **Previous** Contacts:
   - **Relationship**: The number of contacts in the current and previous campaigns can indicate the level of client engagement and familiarity with the bank.
   - **Effect on Term Deposit**: Clients with a moderate number of contacts are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit due to increased familiarity and trust, while too many contacts might lead to annoyance and reduced likelihood.

8. **Pdays** and **Previous** Contacts:
   - **Relationship**: The number of days since the last contact can impact client recall and responsiveness.
   - **Effect on Term Deposit**: Clients recently contacted are more likely to remember the bank and consider the term deposit offer, while long gaps might reduce engagement.

9. **Poutcome** and **Previous** Contacts:
   - **Relationship**: The outcome of previous campaigns affects the likelihood of success in the current campaign.
   - **Effect on Term Deposit**: Positive outcomes in previous campaigns indicate higher chances of term deposit subscriptions in current campaigns.

10. **Social and Economic Context Attributes (Employment Variation Rate, Consumer Price Index, Consumer Confidence Index, Euribor 3 Month Rate, Number of Employees)**:
    - **Relationship**: These indicators collectively reflect the overall economic environment.
    - **Effect on Term Deposit**: Favorable economic conditions (e.g., high employment rates, low inflation, high consumer confidence) increase the likelihood of clients subscribing to term deposits due to better financial stability and optimism.

### Summary of Effects on the Output Variable (Term Deposit)

- **Positive Influences**: 
  - Higher age (older clients), stable and higher-paying jobs, higher education levels, positive past campaign outcomes, longer call durations, favorable economic indicators.
  - Clients with moderate contact frequency and recent engagements.
  
- **Negative Influences**:
  - Younger clients with unstable jobs, lower education levels, history of defaults, excessive contact frequency, unfavorable economic indicators.

Paper

Focusing on the case study of bank telemarketing, it is difficult to financially quantify costs since long-term deposits have different amounts, interest rates, and subscription periods. Moreover, human agents are hired to accept inbound phone calls, as well as sell other non-deposit products. In addition, it is difficult to estimate the intrusiveness of an outbound call (e.g., due to a stressful conversation).
